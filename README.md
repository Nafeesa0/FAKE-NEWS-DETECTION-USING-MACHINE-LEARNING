# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

The rapid growth of digital media and online news platforms has led to the widespread dissemination of fake news, which poses serious social and cultural challenges. The inability to distinguish between genuine and misleading information can negatively influence public opinion and decision-making. To address this issue, this project focuses on developing a machine learning–based system capable of automatically identifying and classifying news articles as fake or real. The system is trained using a diverse and labeled dataset of news articles and evaluates multiple classification techniques to achieve reliable and accurate predictions.

MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS USED

1.Logistic Regression:
A statistical classification method used as a baseline model for text-based fake news detection.

2.Decision Tree Classifier:
A tree-structured model that classifies news based on feature-based decision rules.

3.Gradient Boosting Classifier:
An ensemble learning technique that improves classification accuracy by combining multiple weak learners.

4.Random Forest Classifier:
An ensemble of decision trees that enhances prediction accuracy and reduces overfitting.

**Project Overview** 

Fake news has become a serious problem in today’s digital era, where information spreads rapidly through social media and online platforms. The distribution of false or misleading news can negatively impact individuals, society, and culture.
This project aims to develop a machine learning–based system that automatically identifies and classifies news articles as fake or real, helping to reduce the spread of misinformation.
